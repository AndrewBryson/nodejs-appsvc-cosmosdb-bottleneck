# Load Test Workshop Challenges

This is a short series of challanges that can be used in an interactive workshop to get hands on experience with Azure Load Testing.

It uses the sample application and sample load test script in this repository.

## Challenge One - Create Load Test Resource


## Challenge Two - Create a Demo System Under Test

## CHallenge Three - Run some load tests, checking results and changing scale to improve the application

May need here to achieve a target request rate that is in excess of what the service can deliver out of the box.

This may need several iterations.

What needed to change to acheive the desired request rate?

## Challenge Four - Generate a JMeter Dashboard of the results

## Challenge Five - Automate load testing in a GitHub Action

Need to think:
1. when the action will run
2. How the action step is authenticated
3. How to drive parameters into the test
4. How to set success criteria
 
## Challenge Six - Load test your own application's endpoint

1. Create/amend a JMX file. 
2. Run load test interactively
3. Discuss what changes may be needed to the application or test to get better results
4. Automate in GitHub action - setting success criteria
